# Neural_Net_101
Welcome. Its been a while since my last update. Today is a special day for me, I have wrote a very simple neural network from scratch, I seen it as the first step of a grate journey.
Apart from my shitty code, my program aim to accomplish learning from 250 people's Weight, Height, Index and Gender information. Based on the trained data, I hope it would predict people's gender by giving Weight, Height, and body Index. 
The next step is using more advanced libraries such as Tensorflow/Pychorch to simplified my code as well as learn to optimize my algorithm in order to improve efficiency.
Stay turned...
